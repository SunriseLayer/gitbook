# Liquid staking

## Liquid Staking Token (LST)

In the Sunrise blockchain, the issuance of Liquid Staking Token (LST) is supported natively.
The LST tokens of $SR are preserved as `microBondedSR-[validator-address]` in the Sunrise blockchain.
It means that the LSTs of different validators are not fungible with each other.
By creating a basket of these LSTs, anyone can develop plain LST.
