# Archive

Generally modular Data Availability layer serves data availability for a certain period like the challenge period of fraud proofs of Optimistic rollup or the latency of validity proofs of ZK Rollup, because Layer 2 doesn't require data availability after the finalization of the L2 state accomplished.
It means that the data of Data Availability layer like Celestia, Avail and so on will be generally "pruned".

Sunrise hear the voices of the market like Blockchain Game developers that Layer 2 BCGs want the persistency of the data even after the L2 state get finalized, for the purpose of utilizing the gaming history.
So We will serve a mechanism to preserve full archive data as a network.
It means that the operation of full archive nodes of Sunrise is not voluntary.

`archive` module incentivizes people to run full archive nodes.
