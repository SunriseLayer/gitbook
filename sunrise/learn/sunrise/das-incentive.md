# DAS Incentive

Sunrise is based on Celestia's Data Availability architecture, but we think that the incentive mechanism for the Data Availability layer is not enough in the Celestia's architecture. So we introduce the DAS Incentive mechanism.

By introducing this mechanism, we can expect DAS light nodes to have enough bandwidth and it leads to the improvement of data throughput and shortening the time to finality.
