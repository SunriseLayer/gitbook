# Liquidity Pool

This module is for minting LP tokens of `XXX/BondedSR` for [Liquidity Retaking module](../sunrise/liquidity-restaking.md) and [Sovereign Proof of Liquidity](../sunrise/spol.md).

The tokens in the pool can be swapped by using the ratio derived from constant product formula $x y = k$.
