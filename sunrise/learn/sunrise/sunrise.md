# Sunrise

Sunrise is a L1 blockchain that supports building blockchains with modular blockchain paradigm, as a Data Availability layer.
Any blockchain builders can use Sunrise for Data Availability. It means that data of the blockchains will be presered in Sunrise network.

Sunrise has a mechanism called Data Availability Sampling, hence it can support any blockchain builders to build scalable blockchain.

Sunrise DA layer has a compatibility with Celestia ecosystem.
Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) providers who integrated Celestia can integrate Sunrise easily, and Rollup SDKs (e.g. OP stack, Polygon CDK, Rollkit, Sovereign SDK, and so on) which support Celestia, can also support Sunrise easily.

Celestia-compatible features:

- Blob Tx
- BlobStream

In addition, Sunrise has unique features:

- Acceptance of restaking
- Acceptance of any token for DA fee (BlobGrant)
- Native Liquid Staking
- Sovereign Proof of Liquidity (SPoL)

Furthermore, Sunrise is IBC compatible.
