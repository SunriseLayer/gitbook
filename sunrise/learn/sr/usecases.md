## Restaking for modular elements

As referred to in the [Liquid Staking](../sunrise/liquid-staking.md) section, $BondedSR can be staked to other modular elements. In other words, $SR can be restaked to other modular elements.

In the modular blockchain ecosystem, there are many elements that have voting power but don't have Consensus / Data Availability. For example, Shared sequencer, Shared prover, Shared verifier, Sovereign rollup, etc.

We believe that the only layer of the token that can enhance the security of other modular elements without additional trust assumptions is the DA layer. For example, enhancing the security of Sovereign rollup by using the LST of the DA layer doesn't introduce any additional trust assumptions (or tokens). Sovereign Proof of Liquidity (SPoL) is also an idea that aligns with this concept. So we think that the usecases of DA tokens are very wide, not only for the DA chain.
