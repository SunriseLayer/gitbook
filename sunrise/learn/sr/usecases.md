# Usecases of $SR

## Restaking for modular elements

As referred to in the [Liquid Staking](../sunrise/liquid-staking.md) section, $BondedSR can be staked to other modular elements. In other words, $SR can be restaked to other modular elements.

In the modular blockchain ecosystem, there are many elements that have voting power but don't have Consensus / Data Availability. For example, Shared sequencer, Shared prover, Shared verifier, Sovereign rollup, etc.
