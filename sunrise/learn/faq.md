# FAQ

## Who are Sunrise’s users?

Layer 2 blockchain developers or Sovereign rollup developers will use Sunrise directly. Other users can use Sunrise to participate in staking and governance.

## What is the $SR token used for?

See [here](sr/sr.md).

## Is Sunrise the same as Celestia?

Sunrise has compatibility with Celestia when Layer 2 developers use Sunrise as a Data Availability layer. However, Sunrise also has unique features&#x20;

・Acceptance of any token for DA fee (BlobGrant)&#x20;

・Native Liquid Staking&#x20;

・Liquidity Restaking&#x20;

・DAS Incentive&#x20;

・Incentive for optional long term data availability ・Sovereign Proof of Liquidity (SPoL)

## What is the advantage of Sunrise as an alt DA of Smart contract rollup?

See [here](sunrise/blobgrant.md)

## Doesn't "Any token for DA fee" enhance the value of $SR?

Yes, it does. Tokens paid for DA fee will be distributed to $SR stakers after being locked in Gluon. It won't be distributed to users who don't stake $SR so it will be the incentive to get and stake $SR.

## What is the advantage of Sunrise as a DA of Sovereign rollup?

See [here](sunrise/spol.md)

## Is there any effect on the Sunrise by ProtoDanksharding and Danksharding?

With EIP-4844 ProtoDanksharding, the gas fee of Ethereum L2s gets cheaper. However, ProtoDanksharding lacks the Data Availability Sampling technology. DAS will be implemented in DankSharding upgrade but it takes much longer time. Furthermore, using Sunrise as an alt DA of Smart contract rollup is just a part of Sunrise's use case. We think that the full potential of Sunrise will be released for Sovereign rollup.
