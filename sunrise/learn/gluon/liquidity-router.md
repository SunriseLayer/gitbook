# Liquidity Router

This module is a router to swap tokens of which liquidity is provided by [Liquidity Pool module](../sunrise/liquidity-pool.md) for [Sovereign Proof of Liquidity](../sunrise/spol.md).

By using IBC interoperability, the tokens of different Sovereign rollups on Sunrise DA that use SPoL can be swapped seamlessly.
