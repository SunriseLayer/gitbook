## What is the `nftbackedloan` module?

UnUniFi’s NFT Backed Loans module allows users to collateralize their NFT assets to access liquidity, while delivering fast, efficient, cross-chain matching between lenders and borrowers. UnUniFi’s unique lending model provides advantages such as low transaction fees, competitive valuations, and support for any NFT. Cross-chain matching also enables liquidity aggregation across chains. Lastly, UnUniFi’s oracle-free valuation mechanism protects retail users against price manipulation and provides valuations with respect to rarity, all based on real-time demand data. This mechanism creates a reliable and scalable NFT valuation service not just for retail users but also for institutional users as well.
