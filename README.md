## What is UnUniFi Protocol ?

### UnUniFi Protocol

White paper:[https://ununifi.io/assets/download/UnUniFi-Whitepaper.pdf](https://ununifi.io/assets/download/UnUniFi-Whitepaper.pdf)

UnUniFi Protocol is an NFT-Fi Platform with DeFi tools, built via Layer1 app-specific blockchain (ASBC) in the Cosmos Network.
UnUniFi provides the tools and features necessary to integrate peer-to-peer DeFi functionality into NFT ecosystems, with an internal NFT marketplace and crosschain products developed for both retail and institutional users.
This includes the first NFTFi Platform to create a proprietary NFT valuation algorithm calculated using real demand data, while allowing users to engage in DeFi activities to generate earnings or rewards from a variety
of lending/borrowing/financing activities and third party protocols relating to NFTs, through an interchain yield aggregator. UnUniFi provides the infrastructure to be the NFT-Fi Hub for Cosmos and beyond. Our mission is to ”Give all NFTs the opportunity to DeFi”.

### NFT-Fi

Use our NFTFi Platform by either listing your NFT on the marketplace or bidding on a listed NFT. Our unique bidding mechanism allows for liquidity aggregation. Listing an NFT collateralizes it, allowing you access to flexible loans or simply accepting a bid to quickly sell your NFT.

For more information, visit [NFT Backed Loan](overview/nft-backed-loan.md) page.


### InterChain Yield Aggregator

Users can then generate automatic DeFi yield on their assets using our Interchain Yield Aggregator.

### Derivatives

In UnUniFi protocol, perpetual futures and perpetual options trading are provided. Tokens procured through NFT-Fi can be operated within the UnUniFi protocol.
