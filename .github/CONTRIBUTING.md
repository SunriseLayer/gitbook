Thank you for considering making contributions to the UnUniFi gitbook repository!

**To ensure a smooth workflow for all contributors, the general procedure for contributing has been established:**   

Start by browsing new issues and discussions.    
If you are looking for something interesting or if you have something in your mind, there is a chance it had been discussed.   
Looking for a good place to start contributing?   

**Determine whether a GitHub issue is more appropriate for your needs:**   

If want to propose something new, or you would like to change a process, start with a new issue with close description. 
Review existing issues to find an issue you'd like to help with.   

**If you would like to contribute:**   

Ensure that the proposal has been accepted.   
If nobody has been assigned for the issue and you would like to work on it, make a comment on the issue to inform the community of your intentions to begin work.   
To submit your work as a contribution to the repository follow standard GitHub best practices. See pull request guideline below.   
Note: For very small or blatantly obvious problems such as typos, you are not required to an open issue to submit a PR, but be aware that for more complex problems/features, if a PR is opened before an adequate design discussion has taken place in a GitHub issue, that PR runs a high likelihood of being rejected.
